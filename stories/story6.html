    <h1 class="title">WINDOWS RE-INSTALLATION</h1>
    <br>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Setup</h2>
    <p class="itself">Andrew was a regular guy with a not-so-regular problem: his computer was infested with viruses that seemed to multiply like rabbits. After countless hours of frustration, he decided it was time for a drastic measure—reinstalling Windows. However, Andrew had the technical know-how of a potato, and that’s where the hilarity began.</p>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">Great Plan</h2>
    <p class="itself">One sunny afternoon, Andrew sat down at his cluttered desk, surrounded by empty soda cans and crumpled snack wrappers. He opened his laptop and stared at the screen, which was covered in pop-up ads and bizarre error messages like “Your computer is haunted!” He took a deep breath and declared, “Today is the day I become a tech wizard!” He quickly Googled “how to reinstall Windows,” but instead of helpful guides, he found a forum thread titled “Windows Reinstallation for Dummies.” With newfound determination, he clicked on it, only to be greeted by an animated GIF of a dancing cat with the caption: “You can do it!”</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">The Preparation</h2>
    <p class="itself">Feeling inspired, Andrew gathered supplies as if preparing for a camping trip. He grabbed:

        A USB drive (which he later discovered was filled with old vacation photos).
        A notebook to jot down instructions (which turned into doodles of superheroes).
        A snack stash because tech support requires energy!
    
    After several hours of searching for the right USB drive in his cluttered room, he finally found one that wasn’t corrupted by his previous attempts at “cleaning” his computer.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Installation Attempt</h2>
    <p class="itself">With everything ready, Andrew followed the instructions he found online. “Step one: Insert the USB drive.” Check! “Step two: Restart your computer.” Check! But when he rebooted, instead of seeing the Windows installation screen, he was met with the dreaded blue screen of death. “Maybe it’s just shy,” he muttered to himself. After several more failed attempts and some creative cursing, Andrew decided to take a break. He made himself a sandwich and contemplated life choices while watching cat videos.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">What A Twist</h2>
    <p class="itself">Feeling refreshed (and slightly more confused), Andrew returned to his laptop. This time, he accidentally clicked on an ad that promised to “Fix All Your Computer Problems Instantly!” Without thinking twice, he downloaded the software. To his surprise, it was not a virus but a tool that claimed it could help him reinstall Windows. “Finally!” he exclaimed. He followed the prompts and soon found himself staring at an installation screen that looked suspiciously like a video game loading screen. As progress bars filled up, Andrew felt like he was on an epic quest.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Final Countdown</h2>
    <p class="itself">Just as the installation reached 99%, his computer emitted a loud beep and shut down completely. “No! Not now!” Andrew yelled dramatically as if his laptop were a beloved pet in peril. After what felt like an eternity of waiting (and several more sandwiches), his computer finally powered back on. To his astonishment, it booted up normally—no viruses in sight! However, when Andrew opened his browser to celebrate by watching cat videos again, he was met with an error message: “Your internet connection has been lost.” In his excitement to reinstall Windows, he had forgotten to reconnect his Wi-Fi!</p>
