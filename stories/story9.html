    <h1 class="title">KING OF MONKEYS</h1>
    <br>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Setup</h2>
    <p class="itself">Once upon a time in the heart of the jungle, there lived a monkey king named George. King George was not your average monkey; he was the self-proclaimed ruler of all monkeys, and he wore a shiny crown made from the finest banana peels. His kingdom was filled with playful monkeys who loved to swing from vines, eat bananas, and cause delightful chaos.</p>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">Accidental Discovery</h2>
    <p class="itself">One sunny day, while rummaging through a pile of leaves, King George stumbled upon a shiny object. It was a mobile phone! Curious as ever, George picked it up and pressed a big button. Suddenly, loud music started blasting from the device. The monkeys were intrigued and gathered around their king, chattering excitedly. “What is this magical box?” asked Mimi, the youngest monkey. “I don’t know,” replied King George, scratching his head. “But it makes noise! Let’s press more buttons!”</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Monkey Mayhem</h2>
    <p class="itself">As they pressed buttons randomly, they discovered that the phone could do all sorts of silly things. They could take pictures of themselves making goofy faces, and they even found a feature that made funny sounds when they barked like dogs or meowed like cats. The monkeys decided to throw a “Monkey Phone Party” to celebrate their new toy. They invited all the animals in the jungle: parrots, elephants, and even the grumpy old tortoise who lived by the river.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">At The Party</h2>
    <p class="itself">When the party started, King George used the phone to play music. The monkeys danced wildly, swinging from branches and doing backflips. The elephants joined in with their own dance moves, which mostly involved shaking their trunks and stomping their feet. Suddenly, George accidentally dialed an emergency number! On the other end of the line, a confused human answered. “Hello? Is this an emergency?” asked the voice. King George, thinking quickly, replied, “Yes! We need more bananas for our party!” The human laughed so hard that he hung up, thinking it was a prank call. But soon after, curious humans started showing up in the jungle with bags of bananas after hearing about the “monkey party” on social media!</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Banana Bonanza</h2>
    <p class="itself">With mountains of bananas piling up, King George declared it a Banana Bonanza! Monkeys swung from tree to tree, tossing bananas to each other while laughing hysterically. They even took selfies with their new mobile phone to capture every silly moment. However, things took a turn when one monkey accidentally dropped the phone into a mud puddle. The screen went dark! Panic ensued as they all gathered around it. “Oh no! Our magic box is broken!” cried Mimi.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Phone Fixer</h2>
    <p class="itself">King George calmed everyone down. “Fear not! We shall fix it!” He remembered seeing humans use tools to repair things. So he gathered sticks and stones and began poking at the phone in an attempt to "fix" it. To everyone’s surprise, after much poking and prodding (and some accidental banana smashes), the phone flickered back to life! The monkeys cheered as King George triumphantly held it up high.</p>
