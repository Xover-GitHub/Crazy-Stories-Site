    <h1 class="title">THE WEB MAGIC</h1>
    <br>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Setup</h2>
    <p class="itself">Once upon a time in the whimsical town of Fluffington, there lived a rotund cat named Sir Whiskers McFluff. Sir Whiskers was not your ordinary cat; he was a self-proclaimed web programmer. With his belly bouncing like a bowl of jelly, he would often sit in front of his shiny laptop, paws on the keyboard, typing away with all the seriousness of a cat working on a top-secret project. “Today, I shall create the greatest website in the history of cat-kind!” he declared one sunny afternoon, his tail flicking with excitement. But little did he know, Sir Whiskers didn’t know the first thing about web programming!</p>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">Idea!!!</h2>
    <p class="itself">One day, while munching on a tuna-flavored snack, Sir Whiskers had an epiphany. “I shall build a website dedicated to my favorite pastime: napping!” He envisioned a site called Naptastic.com, where cats from all over could share their best napping spots and techniques. With determination in his eyes, he began to “program.” He opened a blank document and stared at it for what felt like an eternity. “Hmm… I need some magic words,” he mused, scratching his head with his fluffy paw. He typed:

        cat = "nap"
        cat + "snack" = "happy"
        
        “Perfect!” he exclaimed. “Now I just need to find the ‘web magic’ to make it all come together!”</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Web Magic Search</h2>
    <p class="itself">Sir Whiskers decided that to find this elusive web magic, he needed to consult the wisest creature in Fluffington: Grandma Tilly, the ancient tortoise known for her vast knowledge of all things techy (which mostly consisted of knowing how to turn on her television). “Grandma Tilly!” Sir Whiskers cried, waddling over to her cozy garden. “What is the secret to creating a website?” Grandma Tilly blinked slowly and replied, “Well, dearie, you need HTML, CSS, and maybe a sprinkle of JavaScript.” “HTML? CSS? JavaScript? Sounds like spells!” Sir Whiskers said, eyes wide with wonder. “Where do I find them?” “Just look inside your computer,” she said with a chuckle.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Abracadabra</h2>
    <p class="itself">Back at home, Sir Whiskers approached his laptop with newfound determination. He opened it up and stared at the screen as if it were a treasure chest waiting to be unlocked. “Alright! Time for some web magic!” he declared. He started typing random letters and numbers:

        abracadabra123
        hocuspocus456
        webmagic789
        
        To his surprise, nothing happened! The screen just sat there looking blank and unresponsive. “Maybe I need more snacks for inspiration!” he exclaimed and promptly devoured an entire can of tuna.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Sleep Power</h2>
    <p class="itself">Feeling inspired (and slightly bloated), Sir Whiskers decided to take a break and curl up on his keyboard for a nap. As he snoozed peacefully, his fluffy body accidentally pressed down on several keys. When he woke up an hour later, he noticed something odd: his laptop screen was filled with colorful squiggles and strange shapes! “What is this sorcery?” he gasped. It turned out that while he napped, the random key presses had created an accidental masterpiece—a psychedelic art piece that looked like a cat had thrown up rainbows!</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Going Viral</h2>
    <p class="itself">Feeling adventurous, Sir Whiskers decided to publish this bizarre creation on Naptastic.com. To his utter shock, cats from all over Fluffington loved it! They began sharing their own silly art made from accidental key presses and napping stories. Before long, Naptastic.com became the most popular site in town! Cats were laughing and sharing their own goofy creations while Sir Whiskers basked in the glory of being the accidental web magician.</p>
