    <h1 class="title">DOTA 2 (TOXIC)</h1>
    <br>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Setup</h2>
    <p class="itself">Once upon a time in the pixelated land of Dota 2, there lived a 14-year-old kid named Alex. Eager to dive into the world of heroes, creeps, and epic battles, Alex logged onto his computer one fateful Saturday afternoon, ready to play his first match of Dota 2.</p>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">Great Adventure</h2>
    <p class="itself">Alex had heard tales of Dota 2’s legendary gameplay, but he was blissfully unaware of the lurking shadows—the toxic community. He selected his favorite hero, a charming little character named Pudge, who was known for his ability to hook enemies and make them fly through the air like ragdolls. With a grin plastered on his face, he clicked “Play” and entered the matchmaking realm.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Toxic Jungles</h2>
    <p class="itself">As the game loaded, Alex felt a surge of excitement. But as soon as he joined the lobby, he was greeted not by friendly banter but by a barrage of insults. “Why did you pick Pudge? You’re such a noob!” shouted one player named ToxicTom. Another chimed in with, “Get ready to lose, loser!” Alex’s smile faded faster than a hero caught in a smoke screen. What was happening? The excitement turned into confusion as he tried to communicate with his team. “Hey guys, let’s work together!” he typed eagerly. But instead of encouragement, he received a flood of messages filled with rage and disdain. “Shut up and play!” yelled FlameyFrank, while SaltySarah added, “You’re just going to ruin this game!”</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Hook And Hope</h2>
    <p class="itself">Despite the negativity, Alex decided to focus on his gameplay. He hooked an enemy hero and felt like a champion! But before he could celebrate, ToxicTom yelled out, “Nice hook! Too bad you’re still trash!” Feeling deflated but determined, Alex continued to play. He even managed to score a few kills! But then disaster struck. In a moment of miscommunication, Alex accidentally hooked his own teammate instead of an enemy. The chat erupted into chaos. “What are you doing?!” screamed SaltySarah. “You’re throwing the game!” FlameyFrank added fuel to the fire with a string of insults that made Alex’s head spin.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Escapeee</h2>
    <p class="itself">Feeling overwhelmed by the toxic barrage, Alex muted everyone in the chat. “I just want to play!” he thought desperately. As he focused on his gameplay without distractions, he realized something profound: he was having fun again! He hooked enemies without worrying about what others thought and even managed to help his team secure a victory. However, as soon as the game ended, he was met with an avalanche of reports from his teammates for being “too quiet.” The post-game chat was filled with more insults than compliments. “You deserve low priority!” they all shouted in unison.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Lesson Learned (And Gulped Shit)</h2>
    <p class="itself">After logging off that day, Alex reflected on his experience. He had entered Dota 2 hoping for camaraderie but found himself in a battlefield not just against enemy heroes but against his own teammates’ toxicity. Determined not to let it ruin his love for gaming, Alex decided that next time he would choose a different game—one where players were less likely to hurl insults like they were throwing spells. And so, with a heart full of hope and a head full of lessons learned about online gaming communities, Alex logged off Dota 2 for good… or at least until he felt brave enough to face the toxic jungle again. In the end, Alex learned that while Dota 2 could be an epic adventure filled with heroes and battles, it also came with its fair share of trolls hiding under bridges—waiting to unleash their toxicity on unsuspecting players like him!</p>
