    <h1 class="title">COCKROOOOOACH</h1>
    <br>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Setup</h2>
    <p class="itself">Once upon a time in a cluttered little flat on the fifth floor of an old apartment building, there lived a colony of cockroaches. But these were no ordinary cockroaches; they were the Cockroooooach Army, led by their fearless and slightly goofy commander, General Crunchy Legs. With antennae held high and tiny helmets made from bottle caps, they were ready to take over the humans’ territory.</p>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">Master's Plan</h2>
    <p class="itself">One sunny afternoon, General Crunchy Legs gathered his troops in the shadow of the fridge. “Listen up, my crunchy comrades!” he squeaked, waving a tiny plastic sword. “Today is the day we reclaim our rightful home! The humans think they own this flat, but we will show them who’s boss!” The cockroaches cheered, their tiny voices creating a symphony of squeaks and clicks. “What’s the plan, General?” asked Private Squish, who was always a little too eager for action. “Simple!” replied Crunchy Legs. “We’ll launch a surprise attack during their dinner! They’ll never see it coming!”</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Dinner Distraction</h2>
    <p class="itself">As evening approached, the humans began preparing dinner. Little did they know that the Cockroooooach Army was already in position behind the couch, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. “Now!” shouted General Crunchy Legs as he waved his sword dramatically. The army scuttled out in unison, marching toward the kitchen like an army of tiny soldiers. But just as they reached the dining table, disaster struck! One of the humans—let’s call him Dave—dropped a whole plate of spaghetti on the floor. The cockroaches skidded to a halt, mesmerized by the sight of noodles cascading like a waterfall. “Forget the takeover! Spaghetti attack!” yelled Corporal Crunchy.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Spaghetti (NYEH-HEH-HEH???)</h2>
    <p class="itself">The Cockroooooach Army dove into the pile of spaghetti with glee. They twirled noodles around their antennae and danced on meatballs like they were on a carnival ride. General Crunchy Legs tried to regain control, but it was too late—the army was lost in a feast of epic proportions. Meanwhile, Dave and his roommate Sarah were horrified. “Did you see that?!” Sarah shrieked as she pointed at the spaghetti-covered cockroaches doing the cha-cha on their dinner table. “Quick! Get the broom!” Dave yelled, but he couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Retreating</h2>
    <p class="itself">Realizing that their grand invasion had turned into a spaghetti party, General Crunchy Legs knew it was time to retreat. “Fall back! Regroup at the fridge!” he commanded. The Cockroooooach Army scuttled back to safety, bellies full of spaghetti and meatballs. As they huddled together behind the fridge, they couldn’t stop giggling about their unexpected feast. “Who knew humans had such good taste?” chuckled Private Squish as he wiped marinara sauce from his antennae.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">C&H Alliance</h2>
    <p class="itself">After their hilarious escapade, General Crunchy Legs had an epiphany. “Why fight when we can feast together?” he pondered aloud. “Let’s negotiate peace!” The next day, armed with leftover spaghetti as their peace offering, the Cockroooooach Army approached Dave and Sarah while they were cleaning up. To everyone’s surprise, Dave laughed instead of screaming. “You guys want some more spaghetti?” he asked. And so began an unusual alliance between humans and cockroaches. From that day forward, every Friday night became Spaghetti Night, where both parties would gather around the table to enjoy endless plates of pasta together—humans on one side and cockroaches on the other.</p>
