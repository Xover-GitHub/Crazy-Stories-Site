    <h1 class="title">PC SET</h1>
    <br>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Setup</h2>
    <p class="itself">Once upon a time in the land of Techlandia, there lived a quirky fellow named Daniel. Daniel was not your average tech enthusiast; he was more like a confused squirrel trying to assemble a puzzle with pieces from different boxes. One sunny day, he ordered a bunch of shiny new PC parts, thinking he would build the ultimate gaming rig. Little did he know, he was about to embark on an adventure filled with goofiness and confusion.</p>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">Mythical Arrival</h2>
    <p class="itself">The day started off with a loud knock on the door. Daniel rushed to open it, and there they were: boxes upon boxes of computer parts! His eyes sparkled with excitement as he tore through the packaging like a kid unwrapping presents on Christmas morning. Inside the boxes were:

        A CPU that looked like a shiny piece of chocolate (but definitely wasn’t edible).
        A motherboard that resembled a giant circuit board from outer space.
        RAM sticks that seemed to be more colorful than his childhood crayons.
        An SSD that promised to make his computer faster than a cheetah on roller skates.
    
    As he piled the parts onto his desk, Daniel realized he had no idea what to do next. He scratched his head, looking at the chaos spread before him.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Confuse... Confuse... Confuse?</h2>
    <p class="itself">Daniel decided to consult the Oracle of Google for guidance. He typed in “How to build a PC” and was immediately bombarded with videos featuring overly enthusiastic tech gurus who spoke in jargon that sounded like a foreign language. “CPU? GPU? What are these mystical creatures?” he muttered to himself. He watched one video where a guy casually said, “Just slot it in!” But slot what in? The CPU? The RAM? Or maybe his pet goldfish? Feeling overwhelmed, Daniel decided to take a break and make himself a snack. As he munched on some chips, inspiration struck! “What if I just throw everything together and hope for the best?”</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Foolish Attempt</h2>
    <p class="itself">With newfound determination (and crumbs all over his shirt), Daniel set out to assemble his PC. He grabbed the CPU and held it up like Excalibur. “This is going to be epic!” he shouted, as if announcing a grand battle. He carefully placed it on the motherboard but forgot to remove the protective cover. “Oops!” he exclaimed, laughing at his blunder. After removing it, he tried to insert the RAM sticks but accidentally dropped one behind his desk. “Great! Now I have a lost RAM stick—just what I needed!” After several minutes of wrestling with cables that seemed to have a mind of their own, Daniel finally managed to connect everything. He looked at his creation proudly, although it resembled more of an art installation than a functional computer.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Truth (Naaah Not)</h2>
    <p class="itself">With bated breath, Daniel pressed the power button. The lights flickered on, and for a moment, everything seemed perfect—until smoke started billowing out from behind the case! “Is this normal?” he panicked as he frantically waved his hands in front of the smoke detector. Realizing it was just some dust burning off from the power supply (thank goodness!), he sighed in relief. Finally, after what felt like an eternity of troubleshooting and googling error messages, Daniel managed to boot up his new PC. It worked! He could hardly believe it.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Daniel LoL</h2>
    <p class="itself">That night, as he sat down to play his favorite game, Daniel couldn’t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. He had successfully built his PC despite not knowing what half the parts were for or how they worked together. From that day forward, Daniel became known as the “PC Wizard” among his friends—not because he was particularly skilled at building computers but because he had turned what could have been a frustrating experience into an unforgettable adventure filled with laughter and goofiness. And so, in Techlandia, whenever someone received new PC parts but didn’t know what to do with them, they would think of Daniel and remember that sometimes it’s okay to be goofy and just wing it!</p>
