    <h1 class="title">MATH???</h1>
    <br>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Setup</h2>
    <p class="itself">Once upon a time in the bustling town of Cheddarville, a group of mice decided that they were tired of nibbling on cheese and running from cats. They wanted to be smarter than the average mouse and thought, “Hey, let’s learn math!” But there was one tiny problem: none of them had any idea what math actually was.</p>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">The Great Math Meeting</h2>
    <p class="itself">One sunny afternoon, the leader of the mice, a particularly ambitious little fellow named Squeaky, gathered all his friends in the town square. “Listen up, everyone! Today we embark on a journey to learn math!” he squeaked excitedly. The other mice looked at each other with wide eyes. “What’s math?” asked Nibbles, who was busy chewing on a piece of paper that he thought might be a snack. “I think it’s something to do with numbers,” said Whiskers, who had just come back from a failed attempt to count how many crumbs were under the fridge. “Numbers? Like how many pieces of cheese we can eat?” asked Cheddar, who was already daydreaming about a cheese buffet. “Exactly! But we need to learn how to add and subtract!” Squeaky declared, puffing out his chest like a tiny superhero.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Confusion</h2>
    <p class="itself">Determined to learn, the mice transformed an old shoebox into their classroom. They found a dusty book titled “Math for Mice” written by the legendary Professor Pawsworth. The first page read: “1 + 1 = 2.” “Okay, so if I have one crumb and I find another crumb…” Squeaky started. “Then you have two crumbs!” interrupted Nibbles, who had already eaten both crumbs. “Wait! How do we know that’s right?” Whiskers asked, scratching his head. “Maybe we should try it!” suggested Cheddar. They decided to gather crumbs from around the shoebox. After much scurrying and nibbling, they returned with two crumbs. “Now add them together!” Squeaky commanded dramatically. Nibbles stared at the crumbs. “But I already ate one… does that still count?” The other mice gasped in horror. “You can’t eat math! It’s not food!” they shouted in unison.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Wild Experiment</h2>
    <p class="itself">Undeterred by their confusion, the mice decided to conduct an experiment. They found some acorns and arranged them in a circle. “Let’s see how many acorns we have!” Squeaky announced proudly. Whiskers counted aloud, “One… two… three… four… five… six… seven… eight… nine… ten!” “That’s ten!” Cheddar exclaimed. “But wait,” Nibbles said, scratching his ear with his tiny paw. “What if I take away three acorns?” “Then we’ll have… um…” The mice stared blankly at each other. “Let’s just eat them!” suggested Cheddar enthusiastically. And so they did, devouring three acorns without a second thought.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Mathematical Disaster</h2>
    <p class="itself">Feeling triumphant after their acorn feast, the mice decided it was time for advanced math. They turned to another page in Professor Pawsworth's book that read: “Multiplication is like adding but faster.” “What does that even mean?” Whiskers asked, looking utterly perplexed. Squeaky scratched his head and said, “Let’s multiply our crumbs! If we have two crumbs and multiply them by two…” “Does that mean we get four crumbs?” Nibbles chirped excitedly. “No way! We just ate those crumbs!” Whiskers exclaimed dramatically. The mice spent hours trying to figure out how many crumbs they would have if they multiplied nothing by nothing. After much debate and several more snacks later, they concluded that math was just too complicated for them.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Cheesy Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="itself">Finally, after a long day filled with confusion and crumbs, Squeaky stood up and declared, “You know what? Math is just like cheese! It looks good on paper but gets all gooey when you try to understand it!” The other mice cheered in agreement. They decided that instead of learning math, they would focus on what they did best: finding cheese! And so, the mice of Cheddarville became famous not for their mathematical prowess but for their incredible cheese-hunting skills. They may not have understood math at all, but they certainly understood how to enjoy life—one crumb at a time! And from that day on, whenever someone mentioned math in Cheddarville, all the mice would giggle and say, “MATH??? No thanks! We prefer cheese!” And they lived happily ever after—confused but content!</p>
